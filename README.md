# PCA-Neuro-Imaging-Analysis
Identified patterns of brain activity in larval zebrafish. Worked with time-varying images that capture a zebrafish's neural activity as it is presented with a moving visual pattern. Implemented distributed PCA from scratch and used PCA to identify distinct patterns across the zebrafish brain that are induced by different types of stimuli.
